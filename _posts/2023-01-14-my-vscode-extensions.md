If you're a developer, you probably use VSCode. It's one of the best code editors out there. It's fast, lightweight, and has a lot of great features.

In this blog post, I'll share some of the VSCode extensions that I use on a daily basis. These extensions make my work easier and help me write better code.

I bet you'll find some of these extensions useful too.

> üìç No theme or color scheme is included in this list. Only extensions that make my work easier.

> üìç I didn't include formatting and linting extensions because there are a lot of them and you can choose the one that suits you best.

> üìç This list is not ordered by importance.

> üìç This list is my personal opinion. I've tried to include the best extensions for developers. If you think I've missed something, please let me know in the comments üëá

Enjoy! üíñ

As I sit down to write this blog post, I can't help but notice the ways in which AI content is all around me. Podcasts, YouTube videos, blog posts, and even tweets are being generated by AI. And while I'm not opposed to AI content in general, I can't help but wonder if it's a good thing.

Blog posts are a great example. There is a lot of AI content out there, and I feel like I'm reading the same blog post over and over again. For example, if a blog post is using words like "Streamline" and "Optimize", I can almost guarantee that it was written by an AI.

Another example, blog posts with old api / methods documentation. I've seen this a lot lately, and it's really frustrating. AI is using old datasets (from 2021 I think).

That's not to say that AI content is all bad. I've seen some really good AI content out there...

Writers will write less, and AI will write more... Content will be without personality, and it will be boring to read.

Without a human touch, it will be difficult to connect with readers. And without a human touch, it will be difficult to build a loyal audience.

Unfortunately, I don't have time to write a long blog post today. I have a lot of work to do, and I need to get back to it. But I hope you enjoyed this short blog post.

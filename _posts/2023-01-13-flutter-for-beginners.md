## ▶️ YouTube Tutorials

YouTube tutorials are a great way to learn Flutter, especially for beginners.
There are many experienced developers who have created comprehensive tutorials that cover everything from the basics of the framework to more advanced concepts.

### ✨ Introduction

## ⭐ Full Courses

First, you need to learn Dart. Dart is the programming language used to build Flutter apps. It's a simple and easy to learn language. If you know Java or JavaScript, you'll find it easy to learn Dart.

I think the best way to learn Flutter is by building a real-world app. So, I've included a few tutorials that will help you build a complete app from scratch.

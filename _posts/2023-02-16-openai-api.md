I have been playing with OpenAI API for a while now, and I have to say, it's pretty cool. Then I had an idea: what if I could use OpenAI API to write comments on social media? Something like grammarly, but for social media.

I started by writing a simple script that would take the post as input, and then generate a comment using OpenAI API. I was pretty happy with the results.

I've been using this extension for a while now, and I have to say, it's pretty cool. LinkedIn is a great place to connect with people, and I've been using it to connect with people in my industry. Just with a few clicks, I can write the perfect comment.

The best thing is it works with any social media platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram). And with any language. English, Spanish, French, German, you name it.

I didn't publish the extension yet, but I'm planning to do it soon. Shoud I make it free or paid? Still not sure. I'm leaning towards paid, but I'm not sure yet.

This is a demo of the extension in action:

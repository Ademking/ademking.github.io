I have been pentesting for a while now and I have used a lot of tools. There are some tools that I use everyday and I thought I would share them with you.

## 1) Nuclei

This is a tool for vulnerability scanning that uses pre-defined templates for detecting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web applications and infrastructure. It can be used to find issues related to networking, containers, and cloud environments.
Nuclei is used to send requests across targets based on a template, leading to zero false positives and providing fast scanning on a large number of hosts. Nuclei offers scanning for a variety of protocols, including TCP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, File, Whois, Websocket, Headless etc. With powerful and flexible templating, Nuclei can be used to model all kinds of security checks.
Example usage:

```
nuclei -t cves/ -u https://example.com
```

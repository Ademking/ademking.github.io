## What is this blog about?

I started this blog as a way to share what I am learning and to document my journey as a developer.
I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and I love learning new things.
Through this blog, I hope to share my knowledge and experiences with others and to help others on their own learning journey.
As a developer, I am constantly learning and growing, and I am excited to see where this blog takes me.
I plan to post a new blog post every day, yes, every day. This is a challenge for me, but I am excited to see how far I can go.

## When did you start programming?

<img style="display: block; margin: auto; padding: 10px; border: 5px #fff solid" src="https://i.imgur.com/uxeV9lQ.jpg" height="300" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

I started programming when I was 10 years old. I was always fascinated by technology. My dad bought me a computer and I started learning how to use it. I had a very old book about programming in BASIC and I started learning how to program. My first program was:

```
10 PRINT "AHLA"
20 GOTO 10
```

The book was very old, so it didn't have any pictures. I had to imagine what the program was doing. I had to imagine what the computer was doing. I had to imagine what the output would look like. I had to imagine everything. It was a very interesting experience. I learned a lot from that book.

My first computer was running Windows ME... The Microsoft Windows ME startup sound really hits hard ü•π [Click here to listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kExkrDuMlC8)

I started playing with 3D Studio Max. I learned how to create 3D models and animations. It was fun.

I also learned how to use Photoshop. I learned how to create logos and banners. I also learned how to use Flash. I learned how to create animations. I was decompiling SWF files and learning how they work. I was also learning how to create my own SWF files. It was a very interesting experience.

I created many visual basic applications... I created a simple text editor, calculator, many games, and more. I wish i still had those applications. I don't know what happened to them.

When I was in 7th year Basic Education (Middle school), I made a very simple website using HTML and CSS. I was very proud of it.

I wish they taught us programming in school. I would have learned a lot more.

In high school, I studied science... Programming is not my specialty. My parents told me to study science and not information technology, and looking back, I think it was a bad decision. I wish I had pursued my interests in IT instead.

We changed places a lot when I was growing up because my father had to move for his job. We moved from Thibar to Beja to Bizerte. I had to change schools a lot. I had to make new friends every time we moved. I didn't have a chance to make many friends. As a result, I spent a lot of time playing with computers.

After high school, I decided to make programming my specialty. I worked hard and was determined to be the best student I could be. I graduated from ISTB in 2019 and I was very proud of myself for my accomplishment.

<img style="display: block; margin: auto; padding: 10px; border: 5px #fff solid" src="https://i.imgur.com/9KehZXB.jpg" height="300" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">

I won the first place in many programming competitions. Me and my team worked hard and we were determined to be the best team we could be. We were very successful.

I really hate bragging... But I also won the award for the best student of the year.

My graduation project was an application for planning, monitoring, and reporting on all of your audit missions using a risk-based approach. It's about the digitalization of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) processes.

I worked hard on this project and the result was amazing. The final product was selected as the best graduation project of the year.

That project turned into a real product. Since starting the company, we have received a lot of positive feedback and interest from potential clients.

I am grateful for the opportunity to turn my graduation project into a real, successful company.
